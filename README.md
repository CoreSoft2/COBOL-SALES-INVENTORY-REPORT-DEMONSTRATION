and then creates SALES REPORT.txt which displays data on how many
sales a certain item got per store, total amount of an item sold
throughout all stores, displays the amount of cash in-flow from 
sales per store and based on all together, and grand totals for
the entire company in all inventory sales and cash in-flow.
